# Deconstructing the University of York's Dual-Track System: An In-depth Guide to Academic Engagement and Visa Compliance

## 2. Core Pillar One: A Detailed Look at the Academic Engagement and Wellbeing (AEW) Policy

The AEW is the foundational framework for ensuring a positive student academic experience and personal wellbeing. Its monitoring points serve as the primary "data source" for the entire system.

### Attendance Monitoring

Students must use the University's Check-In system to electronically register their attendance for all in-person teaching activities (e.g., lectures, seminars). The system automatically records attendance. In the event of an absence, the department will issue an initial reminder via email. If low attendance persists, it will trigger a formal risk assessment and may initiate a case intervention process.

### Assessment Submission Tracking

The submission status of all summative assessments (e.g., assignments, essays) is recorded by the system. Failure to submit on time will be flagged. Multiple or consecutive non-submissions are considered a potential sign of academic disengagement, prompting the departmental academic support team to intervene to understand the situation and offer help before the issue escalates.

### Academic Supervision

Regular interaction with a supervisor is a key component of academic guidance and support.

-   **Taught Postgraduates (PGT):** Students are required to have at least two academic supervision meetings per term, with at least one being a face-to-face, one-on-one meeting. During the summer dissertation/project period, a minimum of three "engagement points" are required.
-   **Postgraduate Researchers (PGR):** Students are required to maintain more frequent contact with their supervisors, typically once every 6-7 weeks, ensuring no fewer than 8 formal supervision meetings per year. Additionally, a formal progress review meeting (TAP) must be held every six months.

All supervision records must be logged in the eVision or SkillsForge system by the supervisor or student within two weeks of the meeting.

### Early Support Mechanisms

The policy emphasizes fairness and inclusivity. When a student's academic engagement is affected by health or other valid reasons, the University provides multiple support pathways, such as assessment extensions, self-certification for sickness absence, and connections to the Student Hub for wellbeing and support services.

## 3. Core Pillar Two: A Detailed Look at the Student Visa Terms and Conditions (SVTC)

The SVTC is a list of mandatory legal obligations that international students must strictly follow, directly impacting the validity of their visa.

### Specificity of CAS & Visa Usage

A student's Confirmation of Acceptance for Studies (CAS) is highly specific and can only be used to apply for the course at the University of York as stated on their offer letter. Any decision to change university or course typically requires a new visa application. Non-compliant use will result in the University reporting the student to UKVI, which may lead to the termination of their current visa and student registration.

### Document Upload & Verification

Students are responsible for uploading proof of their visa application to the eVision system before their course begins. Upon arrival in the UK, they must attend an in-person Student Visa Registration event on campus within three weeks, bringing all original documents, including their passport and BRP (Biometric Residence Permit) collection letter, to complete identity verification. Failure to complete this verification on time may lead to compulsory withdrawal.

### Attendance & Engagement for Compliance

The SVTC explicitly requires international students to fully comply with all monitoring processes under the AEW policy. Any absence or academic disengagement flagged by the AEW system automatically triggers a review by the immigration compliance team. If a student is persistently unresponsive to the University's attempts at contact, the University has a legal obligation to report them to UKVI, which could have serious consequences for their visa status.

### Reporting Changes in Circumstances

Students must proactively report any key changes in their circumstances to the University via the eVision system within 10 working days. This includes, but is not limited to: significant changes to their course or research topic, changes in study/research location, updates to visa type, undertaking a work placement, or taking a leave of absence/deferring studies. Concealing or failing to report such changes is considered a breach of visa conditions.

### Work Restrictions

Students must strictly adhere to the weekly work hour limits and work type restrictions stated on their visa. Engaging in employment beyond the permitted scope is a serious violation. If discovered, the University has the authority to revoke its student visa sponsorship.

## 4. How the Dual Tracks Work Together: Policy in Action

The AEW and SVTC policies are linked through data sharing and procedural integration, forming a closed-loop process from early warning to intervention and, ultimately, to compliance reporting.

### Data Integration: From Academic Monitoring to Compliance Review

The attendance, submission, and supervision records generated by the AEW system form the core chain of evidence used by the SVTC to determine if a student is "genuinely and continuously engaging with their studies." When academic support teams identify a student at risk of disengaging, they will simultaneously inform the visa compliance team to jointly assess potential immigration risks.

### A Tiered Risk Management Mechanism

The system is designed with a multi-level response model:

-   **Tier 1 (Warning):** A minor or single absence triggers an automated email reminder from the department.
-   **Tier 2 (Intervention):** Persistent absence or unresponsiveness escalates the case to student support teams for manual intervention and communication.
-   **Tier 3 (Compliance):** If the student's situation does not improve and contact cannot be established, the Visa Compliance Team will formally intervene and, based on legal obligations, decide whether to make a report to UKVI.

### Flexible Exemption and Recording Mechanisms

The system is not inflexible. If a student needs to be absent due to health issues, they can use self-certification or the official Leave of Absence process to pause the AEW's "absence counter." However, all such requests and approvals must be formally documented in the eVision system to meet the SVTC's record-keeping obligations and justify the absence.

## 5. Practical Checklist: Key Actions at Key Times

| Timeline | Core Actions | Corresponding Policy Clauses |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 7. Key Reminders: Four Points to Mitigate Risk

### 1. The Check-In: An Indispensable Chain of Evidence

Your Check-In record is the most direct evidence that you are actively participating in your studies. Forgetting to check in could cause unnecessary complications during a future compliance review. Make it a habit to check in on time, every time.

### 2. Document Updates: Keep Your Information Current

As soon as you receive a new passport, a new BRP, or an updated ATAS certificate, you must upload it to the eVision system immediately. Outdated information can lead to discrepancies in your official record.

### 3. Proactive Communication: The Best Strategy to Prevent Escalation

Whenever you encounter difficulties that might affect your academic engagement—whether health, family, or academic in nature—communicate proactively and early with your academic supervisor or the relevant support department. The vast majority of issues can be resolved effectively through early communication, which is far better than reactive explanations after the fact.

### 4. Stay Informed on Policy Updates: Keep Abreast of Changes

UKVI immigration regulations and the University's implementation details can change. It is every student's responsibility to regularly check their university email and monitor the official AEW and SVTC webpages for updates.

## Conclusion

The University of York's AEW and SVTC policies together form a robust system designed to safeguard student wellbeing and maintain legal compliance. For international students, the key to success lies in understanding and integrating into this system. By adhering to four simple principles in your daily studies—**"Check-in on time, submit on time, record supervision, and report proactively"**—you can easily achieve both academic and visa compliance. When challenges arise, remember that the University's many support channels are there for you. Seeking help early will not only protect your academic progress but also safeguard your visa status.
