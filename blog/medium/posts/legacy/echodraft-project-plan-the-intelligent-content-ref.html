<h1>EchoDraft Project Plan: The Intelligent Content Refiner for Audio and Video</h1>
<p>The EchoDraft project was thus conceived to address these pain points through automation and intelligent methods. Our goal is to build an end-to-end CLI tool that automates the entire process of handling audio and video content—from downloading, processing, and transcribing to finally generating structured articles. This significantly lowers the barrier and cost of content processing and enhances information retrieval efficiency.</p>
<h2>Technical Architecture Design: Modularity and Efficient Collaboration</h2>
<p>EchoDraft adopts a modular design, ensuring the independence, maintainability, and extensibility of its functional components. The entire processing workflow is meticulously divided into several core stages, unifiedly orchestrated via the command-line interface provided by the Typer framework.</p>
<p>Its core architecture can be summarized by the following workflow:</p>
<blockquote><code>User Input (CLI)</code><br>
<code>    ↓</code><br>
<code>Audio/Video Download (Downloader)</code><br>
<code>    ↓</code><br>
<code>Audio Pre-processing (Audio Processor)</code><br>
<code>    ↓</code><br>
<code>Speech-to-Text (Transcriber)</code><br>
<code>    ↓</code><br>
<code>Intelligent Content Analysis &amp; Generation (Analyzer)</code><br>
<code>    ↓</code><br>
<code>Structured Article Output</code></blockquote><p>This pipeline-oriented design allows each module to focus on its core task, with data seamlessly passed through clear interfaces, ensuring the stability and efficiency of the entire system.</p>
<h2>Core Functional Modules Introduction</h2>
<h3>1. Audio/Video Download Module (<code>modules/downloader.py</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Technology</strong>: <code>yt-dlp</code></li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: Serving as the data entry point for the project, this module leverages the powerful <code>yt-dlp</code> library to support content downloads from mainstream audio/video platforms like YouTube and Bilibili. <code>yt-dlp</code>, with its robust compatibility and continuous updates, can handle various complex download scenarios, ensuring reliable acquisition of raw data.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Audio Processing Module (<code>modules/audio_processor.py</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Technology</strong>: <code>pydub</code></li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This is a critical step in EchoDraft for reducing transcription costs. We utilize <code>pydub</code> to pre-process downloaded audio, primarily involving:<ul>
<li><strong>Audio Acceleration</strong>: Speeding up the audio without significantly compromising sound quality or intelligibility. This effectively shortens the audio duration, thereby substantially reducing the cost of duration-based transcription services (e.g., certain cloud-based Whisper APIs).</li>
<li><strong>Format Conversion and Standardization</strong>: Ensuring the audio format meets the requirements of subsequent transcription modules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Through intelligent audio acceleration, we can maximize cost-effectiveness while maintaining transcription quality.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Speech-to-Text Module (<code>modules/transcriber.py</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Technology</strong>: <code>faster-whisper</code></li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This module is responsible for converting pre-processed audio into high-quality text. We chose <code>faster-whisper</code>, an optimized version of the OpenAI Whisper model, which offers the following advantages:<ul>
<li><strong>High Performance</strong>: Under identical hardware conditions, <code>faster-whisper</code> provides significantly faster inference speeds than the original Whisper.</li>
<li><strong>Local Deployment</strong>: Supports running on local GPUs or CPUs, mitigating data privacy risks and reducing reliance on external APIs.</li>
<li><strong>High Accuracy</strong>: Inherits the Whisper model&#39;s excellent transcription capabilities across multiple languages and complex audio environments.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Provides a fast, accurate, and cost-effective local transcription service, laying a solid foundation for subsequent intelligent analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Intelligent Content Analysis Module (<code>modules/analyzer.py</code>)</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Core Technology</strong>: Large Language Model (LLM) API</li>
<li><strong>Functionality</strong>: This is the &quot;brain&quot; of EchoDraft, responsible for extracting knowledge from transcribed text and generating structured content. By calling LLM APIs, this module achieves the following functionalities:<ul>
<li><strong>Outline Generation</strong>: Automatically identifies themes and key points in the text to generate clear chapter outlines.</li>
<li><strong>Article Generation</strong>: Based on the outline and original text content, generates coherent and logical structured articles, which can be summaries, reports, or in-depth analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Information Extraction</strong>: Future extensions could include keyword extraction, entity recognition, sentiment analysis, and more.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Value</strong>: Transforms large volumes of unstructured audio data into easily readable and understandable structured text, significantly enhancing content usability.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Implementation Progress and Milestones</h2>
<p>Currently, the EchoDraft project has completed the core architecture setup and has initially integrated all key technology modules.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Milestone 1 (Completed)</strong>: CLI entry point (<code>main.py</code>), audio/video download (<code>downloader.py</code>), audio processing (<code>audio_processor.py</code>), and speech-to-text (<code>transcriber.py</code>) modules&#39; basic functionality integration and end-to-end workflow validation.</li>
<li><strong>Milestone 2 (In Progress)</strong>: Intelligent content analysis module (<code>analyzer.py</code>) LLM API integration, implementing basic outline generation and article draft functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Milestone 3 (Upcoming)</strong>: Optimizing LLM output quality, introducing more refined Prompt Engineering techniques to enhance the structural degree, logic, and readability of generated articles.</li>
