<h1>Project Nighthawk Complete Guide: A Self-Evolving Agent OS&#39;s Grand Vision and Technical Core</h1>
<h2>The Technical Core: Four Pillars of Self-Improvement</h2>
<p>To bring this vision to life, we have designed four core subsystems that form the technical foundation for this self-improvement capability. These mechanisms are derived from our detailed technical implementation plan and are the cornerstone of an agent&#39;s ability to evolve from merely &#39;adjusting behavior&#39; to &#39;reforming itself&#39;.</p>
<h3>1. Prompt Iteration Subsystem: Optimizing Self-Expression</h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To enable an agent to automatically optimize its own instructions (Prompts) to counteract execution biases caused by unclear instructions or insufficient information, thus improving task quality at the source.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem Detection</strong>: After a task, the agent&#39;s reflection mechanism determines if a poor result is related to the prompt (e.g., irrelevant answer, missing key points).</li>
<li><strong>Enter Improvement Mode</strong>: Once a prompt issue is confirmed, the agent activates its internal optimization module.</li>
<li><strong>Root Cause Analysis</strong>: Using an LLM, the agent identifies the prompt&#39;s specific flaws, e.g., &quot;The prompt did not explicitly ask for a step-by-step output, leading to a result without a reasoning process.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Generate Candidates</strong>: The agent requests the LLM to generate one or more improved prompt versions based on the analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Evaluate and Select</strong>: The agent selects the best new prompt through internal evaluation (e.g., simulated execution or rule-based judgment).</li>
<li><strong>Apply and Log</strong>: The new prompt is updated in the agent&#39;s configuration, and the change is logged to provide data for future learning.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Intent Lock</strong>: Modifications must focus on improving clarity and must not deviate from the user&#39;s original task intent.</li>
<li><strong>Policy Inheritance</strong>: The new prompt must inherit all security and compliance constraints from the original.</li>
<li><strong>Permission Control</strong>: Only agents with Level 1 or higher permissions can perform this action, with limits on the scope of change.</li>
<li><strong>Audit Trail</strong>: All prompt changes must be fully logged for tracking and analysis.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Schedule Self-Regulation Subsystem: Mastering Operational Tempo</h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To empower an agent to dynamically adjust its own execution frequency and trigger conditions based on actual workload, finding the optimal balance between resource conservation and task latency.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Data Monitoring</strong>: The agent continuously collects scheduling-related data, such as task queue length, idle time, and resource utilization.</li>
<li><strong>Problem Diagnosis</strong>: Based on the data, the agent determines if the current schedule is suboptimal (e.g., long idle times imply frequency is too high; a constantly backlogged queue implies it&#39;s too low).</li>
<li><strong>Formulate Adjustment Plan</strong>: The agent creates a plan, such as &quot;Extend trigger interval from 1 minute to 10 minutes&quot; or &quot;Add a listener for event X to enable instant triggering.&quot;</li>
<li><strong>Simulate and Validate</strong>: Before application, the agent can forecast or simulate the new policy&#39;s impact to ensure positive results.</li>
<li><strong>Apply New Schedule</strong>: The agent modifies its own scheduling configuration (e.g., timer frequency, event subscriptions).</li>
<li><strong>Continuously Evaluate and Rollback</strong>: After application, the agent monitors the outcome. If performance doesn&#39;t improve or worsens, a rollback mechanism is triggered.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequency Boundaries</strong>: Safe upper and lower limits are set for an agent&#39;s scheduling frequency to prevent it from &quot;halting&quot; or creating a self-inflicted &quot;DDoS&quot; attack.</li>
<li><strong>Critical Task Guarantee</strong>: Agents responsible for critical tasks have restricted ability to automatically lower their frequency.</li>
<li><strong>Collaborative Deference</strong>: In multi-agent scenarios, scheduling changes must consider the impact on dependent agents, with arbitration by a coordinator agent if necessary.</li>
<li><strong>Permission Control</strong>: Only agents with Level 2 or higher permissions can modify their schedule.</li>
</ul>
<h3>3. Memory Writing Subsystem: Experience Crystallization and Inheritance</h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To allow an agent to autonomously save key information, lessons learned, and user preferences from tasks into short-term or long-term memory, enabling knowledge accumulation and application in future tasks.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Extract Memory Content</strong>: During the reflection phase, the agent identifies information worth saving (new facts, failure reasons, successful strategies).</li>
<li><strong>Determine Memory Type</strong>: It decides whether the information belongs in &quot;short-term memory&quot; (for the current task chain) or &quot;long-term memory&quot; (the knowledge graph) for lasting value.</li>
<li><strong>Format and Store</strong>: Information is structured (e.g., as nodes and edges in the knowledge graph) and written to the appropriate medium.</li>
<li><strong>Update Index</strong>: After writing to long-term memory, the vector index or graph connections are updated for efficient future retrieval.</li>
<li><strong>Memory Application</strong>: In subsequent tasks, the agent proactively queries its memory, integrating relevant knowledge into the new task&#39;s context to guide its actions.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Privacy and Compliance</strong>: Storing sensitive user information in long-term memory without authorization and anonymization is strictly prohibited.</li>
<li><strong>Veracity Check</strong>: Information written to the long-term knowledge base should be as accurate as possible. Uncertain conclusions must be flagged as &quot;pending verification&quot; or require human confirmation.</li>
<li><strong>Consistency Maintenance</strong>: When writing new knowledge, the agent must check for conflicts with existing entries, performing merges or flagging ambiguities rather than blindly overwriting.</li>
<li><strong>Access Control</strong>: Read/write permissions for the knowledge base are finely controlled to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive knowledge.</li>
</ul>
<h3>4. Code Patch Generation Subsystem: The Ultimate Self-Evolution</h3>
<p><strong>Goal</strong>: To grant the highest-level agents the ability to repair and optimize their own code. This is the ultimate form of self-improvement, meaning an agent can fundamentally fix its flaws and enhance its performance.</p>
<p><strong>Implementation Steps</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Problem Localization</strong>: Through deep reflection, the agent traces the root cause of a problem to a specific location in its own code (e.g., a logic flaw, an inefficient algorithm).</li>
<li><strong>Propose Patch</strong>: The agent uses its coding capabilities (often assisted by a specialized programming LLM) to generate a code modification proposal in a <code>diff</code> format.</li>
<li><strong>Static Analysis and Review</strong>: The generated patch must first pass automated static analysis (e.g., linters) and an independent <strong>review process</strong> (conducted by another Reviewer-Agent or a human developer) to ensure quality and safety.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox Testing</strong>: The approved patch is deployed in an isolated sandbox environment where it runs relevant unit and regression tests to verify its efficacy and harmlessness.</li>
<li><strong>Deploy Application</strong>: Only after passing all validation does the patch get merged into the main codebase and formally deployed via an automated pipeline.</li>
<li><strong>Continuous Monitoring and Emergency Rollback</strong>: Post-deployment, the agent&#39;s performance is closely monitored. If a severe anomaly caused by the patch is detected, an emergency rollback mechanism is immediately triggered, reverting to the last stable version.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Security Policies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Highest Permission Restriction</strong>: Only Level 3 agents can propose code modifications, and they <strong>must</strong> undergo independent review.</li>
<li><strong>Mandatory Review and Authorization</strong>: Every code patch application must have a clear, traceable approval record.</li>
<li><strong>Complete Test Coverage</strong>: Patches must be accompanied by corresponding test cases and pass a full regression suite.</li>
<li><strong>Scope Control</strong>: The size of a single patch is limited to prevent large-scale, hard-to-evaluate changes.</li>
<li><strong>Sandbox Isolation</strong>: All testing must be conducted in a sandbox strictly isolated from the production environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Through the synergistic operation of these four core mechanisms, agents in Nighthawk are no longer static programs but dynamic entities that continuously learn, adapt, and evolve based on environmental feedback and their own performance, taking a solid step toward truly autonomous general intelligence.</p>
