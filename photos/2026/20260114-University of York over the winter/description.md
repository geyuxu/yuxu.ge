Captured in the hush of winter's embrace, this collection reveals the University of York draped in a delicate quilt of frost and snow, where ancient stone meets glistening white, and the tranquil beauty of the campus invites contemplation and wonder. Each frame whispers the serene stillness of a season that transforms the familiar into a magical landscape of academic pursuit and quiet reflection.
